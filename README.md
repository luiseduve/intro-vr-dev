# intro-vr-dev

Basic introduction to develop VR apps for Oculus Quest.

This project adapts the Unity tutorial project [Catapult Physics; Forces, and Energy][desktop-app] to a VR-compatible.

Required Unity Packages:
- Tested on `Unity 2020.1.6f1`
- [Oculus Integration][oculus-int]
- XR Plug-in Management must be v3.2.16
  - It needs to be installed through Package Management, because from Project settings it will try to install v3.2.17 (*which up to Jan2021, presented compilation errors in this Unity version*)
